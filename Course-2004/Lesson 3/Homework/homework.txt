Homework 3.5

Due Tues, Mar 16, 5pm (email to daveb@davebsoft.com, all in a single email with no attachments)
Late homework will not be accepted.

1. Write a program to prompt for strings and store them in a list. Shuffle the list and display
it in its new order. 

2. Create two class rosters (lists) of student names, by prompting for all the names. 

Have the program display both rosters, and then display the names of any students who are in 
both classes. Use this approach: Loop over the elements of the first list, and see if each is 
also in the second list. If it is, display it.

Here's the output from my solution:

----------------------
Math class
Enter names, one per line. Give an empty name when done.
==> dave
==> sue
==> tim
==> 
English class
Enter names, one per line. Give an empty name when done.
==> sue
==> steve
==> pete
==> 
Math class: ['dave', 'sue', 'tim']
English class: ['sue', 'steve', 'pete']
In both classes:
sue
----------------------

My solution uses a function to fetch the list of names. Extra credit if yours does.
