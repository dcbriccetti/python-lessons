Introduction to Python

Objective: To become familiar with Python

Notes

interactive mode

setting variables and displaying their values (integers, reals, strings
a=1
a
b=2
a+b
print a+b
d=7.5
name='Dave'

prompting for input
name = input('What is your name? ')
health = int(input('Enter health value: '))
dist = float(input('Enter distance: '))

creating a program in a .py file

formatted output
print 'Total cost: $%.2f' % totalCost

while loop
while (guess != num)

for loop, range function
for n in range(1,11):
	print n

if statement
if guess == num:
	print "That's right!"
else:
	print "Wrong"

math
import math
print math.pi

Problems:

1) Create a variable called health and give it a value of 100. Subtract 10 from it 
and store the result in health.

2) Prompt for age and store it in an integer variable

3) Prompt for a distance and store it in a float variable

4) Write a program to ask for an age in years and display the age in days 
(assume 365 days per year)

5) Write a program that displays how far a bike moves, given the diameter of
a wheel, and the number of revolutions (prompt for the two values, as floats).

6) Display the integers from 1 to 10, with their squares:
1	1
2	4
3	9
...

6) Display the integers from -5 to 3

7) Ask for an upper limit, and if the number entered is > 1 
then display all the integers from 1 to that limit
